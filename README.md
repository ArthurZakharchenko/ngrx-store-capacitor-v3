# ngrx-store-capacitor

Simple syncing between @ngrx 4 and Capacitor Storage.

## Dependencies

This library depends on the store and effects modules from [@ngrx/platform](https://github.com/ngrx/platform) and [Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/) and is largely based on the [ngrx-store-ionic-storage](https://github.com/natural-apptitude/ngrx-store-ionic-storage) implementation.
